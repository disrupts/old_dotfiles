dotfiles
========

My dotfiles to be shared easily across computers

This is the usual workflow when I format, change of OS or fully upgrade a machine:
  * format to start fresh
  * run the corresponding install script to that machine (found in the [installs repo](https://github.com/disrupts/installs)) 
  * pull this dotfiles
  * Enjoy
